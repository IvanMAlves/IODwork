Mini Project ReadMe
1. My requirements gathering process was quite Adhoc and agile. I wanted to use an AI API for the purposes of trying to select, read and compare information.
2. My application is a very basic Weather AI API, it takes a LAT and LONG as keys to return the current weather of a city. I can then store and compare the result against other cities.
3. It is an external AI API from https://rapidapi.com/hub
4. It takes the Lat and Long coordinates and uses a GET to create a response from the API.
5. The user can select from cities which are stored in a JSON file with corresponding LAT/LONG Coordinates and stores them in a card on the front page.
6. I used Functions for creating cards, showing the response from the API fetching from API.
7. Bootstrap for the cards and selecting the city and also animating the menu bar. This site is also responsive.
8. DIVS, Sections, Templates and Scripts
9. For the CSS I have colors, animations for the menu, cards, non standard font and flexbox.
10. I want to be able to allow the user to delete the cards and also click on the cards for further information or see previous and forecasted weather.
