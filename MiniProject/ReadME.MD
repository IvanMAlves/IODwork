Mini Project ReadMe
1. My requirements gathering process was quite Adhoc and agile. I wanted to use an AI API for the purposes of trying to select, read and compare information.
2. My application is a very basic Weather AI API, it takes a LAT and LONG as keys to return the current weather of a city. I can then store and compare the result against other cities.
3. It is an external AI API from https://rapidapi.com/hub
4. It takes the Lat and Long coordinates and uses a GET to create a response from the API.
5. The user can select from cities which are stored in a JSON file with corresponding LAT/LONG Coordinates and stores them in a card on the front page.
6. I used Functions for creating cards, showing the response from the API fetching from API.
7. Bootstrap for the cards and selecting the city and also animating the menu bar. This site is also responsive.
8. DIVS, Sections, Templates and Scripts
9. For the CSS I have colors, animations for the menu, cards, non standard font and flexbox.
10. I want to be able to allow the user to delete the cards and also click on the cards for further information or see previous and forecasted weather.

Just a reminder about the next mini-project which is due November 21. Some extra info:
The second mini-project is designed to cover the React concepts learned in modules 6 and 7. The goal is to create an interactive page/s of their choice using React. Ideally the app will include interactive elements such as forms, links and buttons, along with routes, data fetching and various React hooks as needed, as well as external libraries such as bootstrap and MUI.
Here are some questions for the students to cover during their presentations to make sure everything is covered:
What was your requirements gathering and design process? Was it useful/successful?
Give a high level overview of your application and its features
Where does its data come from (external/internal APIs)?
How does the back end process this data?
How can the user interact with your application?
Have you used class components or functional components? Why?
How have you structured/broken up your components?
What kinds of React hooks have you used (eg. state, context, effect, navigate)? How?
What external tools/libraries have you used (eg. bootstrap/axios/MUI)? How? Why?
How might you extend the features of your application in future?
